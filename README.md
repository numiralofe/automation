This is my own private automation code folder, mostly It's just a folder for tests and play.

Used tools:

* Bash
* Python
* Terraform
* Consul
* Ansible

It's also a showcase for beginners that might find my test code useful.

It includes:

scripts I use frequently (and can be loaded independently)
stuff that I'm working on, some usable, some still in development (or only ideas for the future)
some projects, applications and tools I made in the past or I'm still working on
lots of code snippets, tests and examples
some code was made by me and other snips are retrieved from the web (on those cases i normally include the credits/links about the author).

Feel free to contact me, send me your comments, problems with my code and/or corrections/improvements.
